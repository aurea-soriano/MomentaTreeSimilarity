# MomentaTreeSimilarity

In this work, we introduce a metric, called Momenta Tree, that uses a set of orthogonal moments in a multi-level data representation, allowing the comparison of simulation models with 4DS data as images, at different scales, and in different domains. After entering the matrices .mat to be compared, the system will return a triangular matrix including the similarity of all the elements.
